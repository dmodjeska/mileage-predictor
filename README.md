# mileage-predictor

This app was developed to help consumers decide which model of car is best for their needs and budget. If you were buying a car in 1974, you were probably concerned about gas prices. After all, an oil crisis had started in October 1973: the Organization of Arab Oil Exporting Countries declared an oil embargo. By March 1974, the price of oil had risen from USD 3 per barrel to almost USD 12 per barrel. So what was a car shopper supposed to do?

It turns out that certain car features have a significant effect on gas mileage. For example, lower weight, few cylinders, and manual transmission all tend to increase gas mileage. To quantify these trade-offs, a model was created using multiple linear regression. The results are shown above in graphical form, and the details follow at the bottom of the About tab in the app.

By playing around with the model in the app, you can get a sense of how each of the input car features affects gas mileage. The black dot moves around in response to your choices. For example, if you choose a 6-cylinder car that weighs 3.5 tons with an automatic transmission, your expected gas mileage is 19 MPG.

Data for this application come from US Motor Trend magazine in 1974. For more information, please see the mtcars data set that comes with RStudio.
